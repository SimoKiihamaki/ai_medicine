# AI in Medicine: Implementation, Privacy, and Ethics

## Overview

This repository contains the full manuscript and supporting materials for our systematic review on the implementation of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Medicine**. The study focuses on **implementation challenges, privacy-preserving AI strategies, ethical considerations, and clinical validation frameworks** in healthcare settings. By analyzing the literature from **2017 to 2025**, we provide a structured overview of AI integration in clinical practice, highlighting key developments and ongoing challenges.

## Research Scope

The manuscript systematically addresses five key research questions:

1. **Implementation Challenges**: What are the major barriers to integrating AI in healthcare workflows?
2. **Privacy and Security**: How can AI maintain data security and protect patient privacy?
3. **Ethical Considerations**: What frameworks ensure responsible AI deployment in healthcare?
4. **Federated Learning and Distributed AI**: How do these approaches address data privacy concerns?
5. **Clinical Validation**: What methodologies ensure AI models are effective and safe for patient care?

## Meta-Level Information

This research has been conducted using generative AI models in **Roo Code**. The tasks have been carried out mainly by Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 and Deepseek R1. The Roo Code setup implements the **memory bank** concept as documented in the **Cline documentation**. The memory bank, along with custom instructions, file organization, and structure, has been adapted to fit the academic writing process. 

A future version of this repository will include additional files and instructions related to:
- The memory bank implementation.
- Custom AI model training instructions.
- Enhanced file organization methodologies for academic research.
- Specific modifications made to Roo Code for optimal research efficiency.
