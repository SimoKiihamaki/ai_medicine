While the presentation, the pathology, and the clinical course of these lesions are variable, the initial investigations are usually similar. Patients who are suspected to have a brain tumor will be assessed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The imaging findings are used by neurosurgeons to determine the feasibility of surgical resection and plan such an undertaking. Imaging studies are also an indispensable tool in tracking tumor progression or its response to treatment. As these imaging studies are non-invasive, relatively cheap and accessible to patients, there have been many efforts over the past two decades to increase the amount of clinically-relevant information that can be extracted from brain imaging. Most recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed to segment and characterize brain tumors, as well as to detect progression or treatment-response. However, the clinical utility of such endeavours remains limited due to challenges in data collection and annotation, model training, and the reliability of AI-generated information. We provide a review of recent advances in addressing the above challenges. First, to overcome the challenge of data paucity, different image imputation and synthesis techniques along with annotation collection efforts are summarized. Next, various training strategies are presented to meet multiple desiderata, such as model performance, generalization ability, data privacy protection, and learning with sparse annotations. Finally, standardized performance evaluation and model interpretability methods have been reviewed.

  abstract = {Investigation of the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, is an exponentially growing field in medicine and healthcare. These methods can be critical in providing high-quality care to patients with chronic rheumatological diseases lacking an optimal treatment, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is the second most prevalent autoimmune disease. Herein, following reviewing the basic concepts of AI, we summarize the advances in its applications in RA clinical practice and research. We provide directions for future investigations in this field after reviewing the current knowledge gaps and technical and ethical challenges in applying AI. Automated models have been largely used to improve RA diagnosis since the early 2000s, and they have used a wide variety of techniques, e.g., support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural networks. AI algorithms can facilitate screening and identification of susceptible groups, diagnosis using omics, imaging, clinical, and sensor data, patient detection within electronic health record (EHR), i.e., phenotyping, treatment response assessment, monitoring disease course, determining prognosis, novel drug discovery, and enhancing basic science research. They can also aid in risk assessment for incidence of comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, in patients with RA. However, the proposed models may vary significantly in their performance and reliability. Despite the promising results achieved by AI models in enhancing early diagnosis and management of patients with RA, they are not fully ready to be incorporated into clinical practice. Future investigations are required to ensure development of reliable and generalizable algorithms while they carefully look for any potential source of bias or misconduct. We showed that a growing body of evidence supports the potential role of AI in revolutionizing screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with RA. However, multiple obstacles hinder clinical applications of AI models. Incorporating the machine and/or deep learning algorithms into real-world settings would be a key step in the progress of AI in medicine.},

However, applications in different specialities are variable and generally limited. Like other conditions, the number of studies employing ML in hypertension research is growing rapidly. In this study, we aimed to survey hypertension research using ML, evaluate the reporting quality, and identify barriers to ML's potential to transform hypertension care. Methods and Results The Harmonious Understanding of Machine Learning Analytics Network survey questionnaire was applied to 63 hypertension-related ML research articles published between January 2019 and September 2021. The most common research topics were blood pressure prediction (38%), hypertension (22%), cardiovascular outcomes (6%), blood pressure variability (5%), treatment response (5%), and real-time blood pressure estimation (5%). The reporting quality of the articles was variable. Only 46% of articles described the study population or derivation cohort. Most articles (81%) reported at least 1 performance measure, but only 40% presented any measures of calibration. Compliance with ethics, patient privacy, and data security regulations were mentioned in 30 (48%) of the articles. Only 14% used geographically or temporally distinct validation data sets. Algorithmic bias was not addressed in any of the articles, with only 6 of them acknowledging risk of bias.

The potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in its prevention and treatment is firmly recognized. Indeed, AI application allows personalized medicine and tailored treatment for each patient. Specifically, this article reviews the benefits of AI in AH management, pointing out diagnostic and therapeutic improvements without ignoring the limitations of this innovative scientific approach. Consequently, we conducted a detailed search on AI applications in AH: the articles (quantitative and qualitative) reviewed in this paper were obtained by searching journal databases such as PubMed and subject-specific professional websites, including Google Scholar. The search terms included artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, deep learning, machine learning, big data, arterial hypertension, blood pressure, blood pressure measurement, cardiovascular disease, and personalized medicine. Specifically, AI-based systems could help continuously monitor BP using wearable technologies; in particular, BP can be estimated from a photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal obtained from a smartphone or a smartwatch using DL. Furthermore, thanks to ML algorithms, it is possible to identify new hypertension genes for the early diagnosis of AH and the prevention of complications. Moreover, integrating AI with omics-based technologies will lead to the definition of the trajectory of the hypertensive patient and the use of the most appropriate drug. However, AI is not free from technical issues and biases, such as over/underfitting, the "black-box" nature of many ML algorithms, and patient data privacy. In conclusion, AI-based systems will change clinical practice for AH by identifying patient trajectories for new, personalized care plans and predicting patients' risks and necessary therapy adjustments due to changes in disease progression and/or therapy response.},

However, this transformation is not without ethical challenges, which require a comprehensive and responsible approach. There are many fields where AI and medicine intersect, such as health education, patient-doctor interface, data management, diagnosis, intervention, and decision-making processes. For some of these fields, there are some guidelines to regulate them. AI has numerous applications in medicine, including medical imaging analysis, diagnosis, predictive analytics for patient outcomes, drug discovery and development, virtual health assistants, and remote patient monitoring. It is also used in robotic surgery, clinical decision support systems, AI-powered chatbots for triage, administrative workflow automation, and treatment recommendations. Despite numerous applications, there are several problems related to the use of AI identified in the literature in general and in medicine in particular. These problems are data privacy and security, bias and discrimination, lack of transparency (Black Box Problem), integration with existing systems, cost and accessibility disparities, risk of overconfidence in AI, technical limitations, accountability for AI errors, algorithmic interpretability, data standardization issues, unemployment, and challenges in clinical validation. Of the various problems already identified, the most worrying are data bias, the black box phenomenon, questions about data privacy, responsibility for decision-making, security issues for the human species, and technological unemployment.

Accessing patient's private data violates patient privacy and traditional machine learning model requires accessing or transferring whole data to train the model. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in federated machine learning, as it provides an effective solution for data privacy, centralized computation, and high computation power. In this paper, we studied the efficacy of federated learning versus traditional learning by developing two machine learning models (a federated learning model and a traditional machine learning model)using Keras and TensorFlow federated, we used a descriptive dataset and chest x-ray (CXR) images from COVID-19 patients. During the model training stage, we tried to identify which factors affect model prediction accuracy and loss like activation function, model optimizer, learning rate, number of rounds, and data Size, we kept recording and plotting the model loss and prediction accuracy per each training round, to identify which factors affect the model performance, and we found that softmax activation function and SGD optimizer give better prediction accuracy and loss, changing the number of rounds and learning rate has slightly effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss but increasing the data size did not have any effect on model prediction accuracy and prediction loss. finally, we build a comparison between the proposed models' loss, accuracy, and performance speed, the results demonstrate that the federated machine learning model has a better prediction accuracy and loss but higher performance time than the traditional machine learning model.},

This development has been further accelerated with the increasing use of machine learning (ML), mainly deep learning (DL), and computing hardware and software advancements. As a result, initial doubts about the application of AI in drug discovery have been dispelled, leading to significant benefits in medicinal chemistry. At the same time, it is crucial to recognize that AI is still in its infancy and faces a few limitations that need to be addressed to harness its full potential in drug discovery. Some notable limitations are insufficient, unlabeled, and non-uniform data, the resemblance of some AI-generated molecules with existing molecules, unavailability of inadequate benchmarks, intellectual property rights (IPRs) related hurdles in data sharing, poor understanding of biology, focus on proxy data and ligands, lack of holistic methods to represent input (molecular structures) to prevent pre-processing of input molecules (feature engineering), etc. The major component in AI infrastructure is input data, as most of the successes of AI-driven efforts to improve drug discovery depend on the quality and quantity of data, used to train and test AI algorithms, besides a few other factors. Additionally, data-gulping DL approaches, without sufficient data, may collapse to live up to their promise. Current literature suggests a few methods, to certain extent, effectively handle low data for better output from the AI models in the context of drug discovery.

The impact of recurrent pathogenic variants is often understood, however there is a long tail of rare genetic variants that are uncharacterized. The problem of uncharacterized rare variation is especially acute when it occurs in genes of known clinical importance with functionally consequential variants and associated mechanisms. Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in these genes are discovered at a rate that outpaces current ability to classify them with databases of previous cases, experimental evaluation, and computational predictors. Clinicians are thus left without guidance about the significance of variants that may have actionable consequences. Computational prediction of the impact of rare genetic variation is increasingly becoming an important capability. In this paper, we review the technical and ethical challenges of interpreting the function of rare variants in two settings: inborn errors of metabolism in newborns and pharmacogenomics. We propose a framework for a genomic learning healthcare system with an initial focus on early-onset treatable disease in newborns and actionable pharmacogenomics. We argue that (1) a genomic learning healthcare system must allow for continuous collection and assessment of rare variants, (2) emerging machine learning methods will enable algorithms to predict the clinical impact of rare variants on protein function, and (3) ethical considerations must inform the construction and deployment of all rare-variation triage strategies, particularly with respect to health disparities arising from unbalanced ancestry representation.},

Ethical and legal boundaries to ensure data privacy hamper collaboration between research institutes. We hypothesize that data sharing is possible without identifiable patient data leaving the radiation clinics and that building machine learning applications on distributed datasets is feasible. We developed and implemented an IT infrastructure in five radiation clinics across three countries (Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands). We present here a proof-of-principle for future 'big data' infrastructures and distributed learning studies. Lung cancer patient data was collected in all five locations and stored in local databases. Exemplary support vector machine (SVM) models were learned using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) from the distributed databases to predict post-radiotherapy dyspnea grade [Formula: see text]. The discriminative performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) in a five-fold cross-validation (learning on four sites and validating on the fifth). The performance of the distributed learning algorithm was compared to centralized learning where datasets of all institutes are jointly analyzed. The euroCAT infrastructure has been successfully implemented in five radiation clinics across three countries. SVM models can be learned on data distributed over all five clinics. Furthermore, the infrastructure provides a general framework to execute learning algorithms on distributed data.

Indeed, the use of AI in mobile health (mHealth) apps could considerably assist both individuals and health care professionals in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, in a person-centered manner. Nonetheless, there are several challenges that must be overcome to provide high-quality, usable, and effective mHealth apps. Here, we review the rationale and guidelines for the implementation of mHealth apps and the challenges regarding quality, usability, and user engagement and behavior change, with a special focus on the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases. We suggest that a cocreation-based framework is the best method to address these challenges. Finally, we describe the current and future roles of AI in improving personalized medicine and provide recommendations for developing AI-based mHealth apps. We conclude that the implementation of AI and mHealth apps for routine clinical practice and remote health care will not be feasible until we overcome the main challenges regarding data privacy and security, quality assessment, and the reproducibility and uncertainty of AI results. Moreover, there is a lack of both standardized methods to measure the clinical outcomes of mHealth apps and techniques to encourage user engagement and behavior changes in the long term. We expect that in the near future, these obstacles will be overcome and that the ongoing European project, Watching the risk factors (WARIFA), will provide considerable advances in the implementation of AI-based mHealth apps for disease prevention and health promotion.},

The vast demand for data and consumption of computational resources are making independent drug discovery increasingly difficult. By integrating federated learning technology into the drug discovery field, we have found a solution that both protects privacy and shares computational power. However, the differences in data held by various pharmaceutical institutions and the diversity in drug design objectives have exacerbated the issue of data heterogeneity, making traditional federated learning consensus models unable to meet the personalized needs of all parties. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an innovative drug discovery framework, MolCFL, which utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the generator and a graph convolutional network (GCN) as the discriminator in a generative adversarial network (GAN). By learning the graph structure of molecules, it generates new molecules in a highly personalized manner and then optimizes the learning process by clustering federated learning, grouping compound data with high similarity. MolCFL not only enhances the model's ability to protect privacy but also significantly improves the efficiency and personalization of molecular design. MolCFL exhibits superior performance when handling non-independently and identically distributed data compared to traditional models. Experimental results show that the framework demonstrates outstanding performance on two benchmark datasets, with the generated new molecules achieving over 90% in Uniqueness and close to 100% in Novelty. MolCFL not only improves the quality and efficiency of drug molecule design but also, through its highly customized clustered federated learning environment, promotes collaboration and specialization in the drug discovery process while ensuring data privacy.

Both the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for classification and a federated learning approach for data privacy preservation show significant performance in the realm of medical imaging fields. In this paper, a custom image dataset was prepared with four classes of skin disease, a CNN model was suggested and compared with several benchmark CNN algorithms, and an experiment was carried out to ensure data privacy using a federated learning approach. An image augmentation strategy was followed to enlarge the dataset and make the model more general. The proposed model achieved a precision of 86%, 43%, and 60%, and a recall of 67%, 60%, and 60% for acne, eczema, and psoriasis. In the federated learning approach, after distributing the dataset among 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 clients, the model showed an average accuracy of 81.21%, 86.57%, 91.15%, and 94.15%.

It is important to improve DDI predictions by integrating multisource data from various pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, the data privacy and financial interest issues seriously influence the interinstitutional collaborations for DDI predictions. We propose multiparty computation DDI (MPCDDI), a secure MPC-based deep learning framework for DDI predictions. MPCDDI leverages the secret sharing technologies to incorporate the drug-related feature data from multiple institutions and develops a deep learning model for DDI predictions. In MPCDDI, all data transmission and deep learning operations are integrated into secure MPC frameworks to enable high-quality collaboration among pharmaceutical institutions without divulging private drug-related information. The results suggest that MPCDDI is superior to other eight baselines and achieves the similar performance to that of the corresponding plaintext collaborations. More interestingly, MPCDDI significantly outperforms methods that use private data from the single institution. In summary, MPCDDI is an effective framework for promoting collaborative and privacy-preserving drug discovery.},

Recent articles on DL-based MRI have not discussed datasets specific to different diseases, which makes it difficult to build the specific DL model. Thus, the article systematically explores a tutorial approach, where we first discuss a classification taxonomy of medical imaging datasets.

In addition, we designed a novel framework that offers insight into how various layers interact with the dataset. Our architecture comprises an input layer, a cloud-based layer responsible for preprocessing and model execution, and a diagnostic layer that issues alerts after successful classification and prediction. According to our simulations, CNN outperformed other models with a test accuracy of 99.285%, followed by VGG-16 with 85.113%, while the ensemble model lagged with a disappointing test accuracy of 79.192%.

However, the training of AI systems is impeded by the limited availability of large datasets due to data protection requirements and other regulatory obstacles. Federated and swarm learning represent possible solutions to this problem by collaboratively training AI models while avoiding data transfer. However, in these decentralized methods, weight updates are still transferred to the aggregation server for merging the models. This leaves the possibility for a breach of data privacy, for example by model inversion or membership inference attacks by untrusted servers. Somewhat-homomorphically-encrypted federated learning (SHEFL) is a solution to this problem because only encrypted weights are transferred, and model updates are performed in the encrypted space. Here, we demonstrate the first successful implementation of SHEFL in a range of clinically relevant tasks in cancer image analysis on multicentric datasets in radiology and histopathology. We show that SHEFL enables the training of AI models which outperform locally trained models and perform on par with models which are centrally trained. In the future, SHEFL can enable multiple institutions to co-train AI models without forsaking data governance and without ever transmitting any decryptable data to untrusted servers.},

Accurate diagnosis is vital for effective treatment planning but is often hindered by the complex nature of tumor morphology and variations in imaging. Traditional methodologies primarily rely on manual interpretation of MRI images, supplemented by conventional machine learning techniques. These approaches often lack the robustness and scalability needed for precise and automated tumor classification. The major limitations include a high degree of manual intervention, potential for human error, limited ability to handle large datasets, and lack of generalizability to diverse tumor types and imaging conditions.To address these challenges, we propose a federated learning-based deep learning model that leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automated and accurate brain tumor classification. This innovative approach not only emphasizes the use of a modified VGG16 architecture optimized for brain MRI images but also highlights the significance of federated learning and transfer learning in the medical imaging domain. Federated learning enables decentralized model training across multiple clients without compromising data privacy, addressing the critical need for confidentiality in medical data handling. This model architecture benefits from the transfer learning technique by utilizing a pre-trained CNN, which significantly enhances its ability to classify brain tumors accurately by leveraging knowledge gained from vast and diverse datasets.Our model is trained on a diverse dataset combining figshare, SARTAJ, and Br35H datasets, employing a federated learning approach for decentralized, privacy-preserving model training. The adoption of transfer learning further bolsters the model's performance, making it adept at handling the intricate variations in MRI images associated with different types of brain tumors.

The traditional domain adaptation method requires sharing data from both source and target domains, which will lead to data privacy issue. To solve it, federated learning is adopted as it can allow models to be trained with multi-site data in a privacy-protected manner. In this paper, we propose a multi-site federated domain adaptation framework via Transformer (FedDAvT), which not only protects data privacy, but also eliminates data heterogeneity. The Transformer network is used as the backbone network to extract the correlation between the multi-template region of interest features, which can capture the brain abundant information. The self-attention maps in the source and target domains are aligned by applying mean squared error for subdomain adaptation. Finally, we evaluate our method on the multi-site databases based on three AD datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed FedDAvT is quite effective, achieving accuracy rates of 88.75%, 69.51%, and 69.88% on the AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC, and AD vs. MCI two-way classification tasks, respectively.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, digital medical imaging in healthcare has become a fundamental tool for medical diagnosis. This growth has been accompanied by the development of technologies and standards, such as the DICOM standard and PACS. This environment led to the creation of collaborative projects where there is a need to share medical data between different institutions for research and educational purposes. In this context, it is necessary to maintain patient data privacy and provide an easy and secure mechanism for authorized personnel access. This paper presents a solution that fully de-identifies standard medical imaging objects, including metadata and pixel data, providing at the same time a reversible de-identifier mechanism that retains search capabilities from the original data. The last feature is important in some scenarios, for instance, in collaborative platforms where data is anonymized when shared with the community but searchable for data custodians or authorized entities. The solution was integrated into an open source PACS archive and validated in a multidisciplinary collaborative scenario.},

  year = {2023},
  abstract = {In brain imaging research, it is becoming standard practice to remove the face from the individual's 3D structural MRI scan to ensure data privacy standards are met. Face removal - or 'defacing' - is being advocated for large, multi-site studies where data is transferred across geographically diverse sites. Several methods have been developed to limit the loss of important brain data by accurately and precisely removing non-brain facial tissue. At the same time, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in medical imaging research for diagnostic classification and prognosis in neurological diseases. These neural networks train predictive models based on patterns in large numbers of images. Because of this, defacing scans could remove informative data. Here, we evaluated 4 popular defacing methods to identify the effects of defacing on 'brain age' prediction - a common benchmarking task of predicting a subject's chronological age from their 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. We compared brain-age calculations using defaced MRIs to those that were directly brain extracted, and those with both brain and face. Significant differences were present when comparing average per-subject error rates between algorithms in both the defaced brain data and the extracted facial tissue. Results also indicated brain age accuracy depends on defacing and the choice of algorithm. In a secondary analysis, we also examined how well comparable CNNs could predict chronological age from the facial region only (the extracted portion of the defaced image), as well as visualize areas of importance in facial tissue for predictive tasks using CNNs. We obtained better performance in age prediction when using the extracted face portion alone than images of the brain, suggesting the need for caution when defacing methods are used in medical image analysis.},

  abstract = {As one of the effective ways of ocular disease recognition, early fundus screening can help patients avoid unrecoverable blindness. Although deep learning is powerful for image-based ocular disease recognition, the performance mainly benefits from a large number of labeled data. For ocular disease, data collection and annotation in a single site usually take a lot of time. If multi-site data are obtained, there are two main issues: 1) the data privacy is easy to be leaked; 2) the domain gap among sites will influence the recognition performance. Inspired by the above, first, a Gaussian randomized mechanism is adopted in local sites, which are then engaged in a global model to preserve the data privacy of local sites and models. Second, to bridge the domain gap among different sites, a two-step domain adaptation method is introduced, which consists of a domain confusion module and a multi-expert learning strategy. Based on the above, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework with domain adaptation is constructed. In the experimental part, a multi-disease early fundus screening dataset, including a detailed ablation study and four experimental settings, is used to show the stepwise performance, which verifies the efficiency of our proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still a threat to global health and safety, and it is anticipated that deep learning (DL) will be the most effective way of detecting COVID-19 and other chest diseases such as lung cancer (LC), tuberculosis (TB), pneumothorax (PneuTh), and pneumonia (Pneu). However, data sharing across hospitals is hampered by patients' right to privacy, leading to unexpected results from deep neural network (DNN) models. Federated learning (FL) is a game-changing concept since it allows clients to train models together without sharing their source data with anybody else. Few studies, however, focus on improving the model's accuracy and stability, whereas most existing FL-based COVID-19 detection techniques aim to maximize secondary objectives such as latency, energy usage, and privacy. In this work, we design a novel model named decision-making-based federated learning network (DMFL_Net) for medical diagnostic image analysis to distinguish COVID-19 from four distinct chest disorders including LC, TB, PneuTh, and Pneu. The DMFL_Net model that has been suggested gathers data from a variety of hospitals, constructs the model using the DenseNet-169, and produces accurate predictions from information that is kept secure and only released to authorized individuals. Extensive experiments were carried out with chest X-rays (CXR), and the performance of the proposed model was compared with two transfer learning (TL) models, i.e., VGG-19 and VGG-16 in terms of accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE), recall (REC), specificity (SPF), and F1-measure. Additionally, the DMFL_Net model is also compared with the default FL configurations. The proposed DMFL_Net + DenseNet-169 model achieves an accuracy of 98.45% and outperforms other approaches in classifying COVID-19 from four chest diseases and successfully protects the privacy of the data among diverse clients.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is deadly cancer causing a considerable number of fatalities among women in worldwide. To enhance patient outcomes as well as survival rates, early and accurate detection is crucial. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated impressive success in various image recognition tasks, including breast cancer classification. However, the reliance on large labeled datasets poses challenges in the medical domain due to privacy issues and data silos. This study proposes a novel transfer learning approach integrated into a federated learning framework to solve the limitations of limited labeled data and data privacy in collaborative healthcare settings. For breast cancer classification, the mammography and MRO images were gathered from three different medical centers. Federated learning, an emerging privacy-preserving paradigm, empowers multiple medical institutions to jointly train the global model while maintaining data decentralization. Our proposed methodology capitalizes on the power of pre-trained ResNet, a deep neural network architecture, as a feature extractor. By fine-tuning the higher layers of ResNet using breast cancer datasets from diverse medical centers, we enable the model to learn specialized features relevant to different domains while leveraging the comprehensive image representations acquired from large-scale datasets like ImageNet. To overcome domain shift challenges caused by variations in data distributions across medical centers, we introduce domain adversarial training. The model learns to minimize the domain discrepancy while maximizing classification accuracy, facilitating the acquisition of domain-invariant features. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse breast cancer datasets obtained from multiple medical centers. Comparative analysis was performed to evaluate the proposed approach against traditional standalone training and federated learning without domain adaptation. When compared with traditional models, our proposed model showed a classification accuracy of 98.8% and a computational time of 12.22 s. The results showcase promising enhancements in classification accuracy and model generalization, underscoring the potential of our method in improving breast cancer classification performance while upholding data privacy in a federated healthcare environment.},

Traditional machine learning methods can be used to diagnose chest X-rays of pneumonia in children, but there is a privacy and security issue in centralizing the data for training. Federated learning prevents data privacy leakage by sharing only the model and not the data, and it has a wide range of application in the medical field. We use federated learning method for classification, which effectively protects data security. And for the data heterogeneity phenomenon existing in the actual scenario, which will seriously affect the classification effect, we propose a method based on two-end control variables. Specifically, based on the classical federated learning FedAvg algorithm, we modify the loss function on the client side by adding a regular term or a penalty term, and add momentum after the average aggregation on the server side. The federated learning approach prevents the data privacy leakage problem compared to the traditional machine learning approach. In order to solve the problem of low classification accuracy due to data heterogeneity, our proposed method based on two-end control variables achieves an average improvement of 2% and an accuracy of 98% on average, and 99% individually, compared to the previous federated learning algorithms and the latest diffusion model-based method. The classification results and methodology of this study can be utilized by clinicians worldwide to improve the overall detection of pediatric pneumonia.},

  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Large training datasets are important for deep learning-based methods. For medical image segmentation, it could be however difficult to obtain large number of labeled training images solely from one center. Distributed learning, such as swarm learning, has the potential to use multi-center data without breaching data privacy. However, data distributions across centers can vary a lot due to the diverse imaging protocols and vendors (known as feature skew). Also, the regions of interest to be segmented could be different, leading to inhomogeneous label distributions (referred to as label skew). With such non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data, the distributed learning could result in degraded models. In this work, we propose a novel swarm learning approach, which assembles local knowledge from each center while at the same time overcomes forgetting of global knowledge during local training. Specifically, the approach first leverages a label skew-awared loss to preserve the global label knowledge, and then aligns local feature distributions to consolidate global knowledge against local feature skew. We validated our method in three Non-IID scenarios using four public datasets, including the Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation (M&Ms) dataset, the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) dataset, the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MMWHS) dataset and the Multi-Site Prostate T2-weighted MRI segmentation (MSProsMRI) dataset.

As a solution, we propose a gradient matching federated domain adaptation (GM-FedDA) method for brain image classification, aiming to reduce domain discrepancy with the assistance of a public image dataset and train robust local federated models for target sites. It mainly includes two stages: 1) pretraining stage; we propose a one-common-source adversarial domain adaptation (OCS-ADA) strategy, i.e., adopting ADA with gradient matching loss to pretrain encoders for reducing domain shift at each target site (private data) with the assistance of a common source domain (public data) and 2) fine-tuning stage; we develop a gradient matching federated (GM-Fed) fine-tuning method for updating local federated models pretrained with the OCS-ADA strategy, i.e., pushing the optimization direction of a local federated model toward its specific local minimum by minimizing gradient matching loss between sites. Using fully connected networks as local models, we validate our method with the diagnostic classification tasks of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder based on multisite resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), respectively.

Nevertheless, building powerful and robust deep learning models requires collecting large and diverse datasets from multiple centers. This raises concerns about ethics and data privacy. Recently, federated learning has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the utilization of multi-center data without the need for data transfer between institutions. Despite its potential, existing federated learning methods face challenges due to the high heterogeneity of data from different centers. Aggregation methods based on simple averaging, which are commonly used to combine the client's information, have shown limited reconstruction and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Model-based Federated learning framework (ModFed) to address these challenges. ModFed has three major contributions: (1) Different from existing data-driven federated learning methods, ModFed designs attention-assisted model-based neural networks that can alleviate the need for large amounts of data on each client; (2) To address the data heterogeneity issue, ModFed proposes an adaptive dynamic aggregation scheme, which can improve the generalization capability and robustness of the trained neural network models; (3) ModFed incorporates a spatial Laplacian attention mechanism and a personalized client-side loss regularization to capture the detailed information for accurate image reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed ModFed is evaluated on three in-vivo datasets. Experimental results show that when compared to six existing state-of-the-art federated learning approaches, ModFed achieves better MR image reconstruction performance with increased generalization capability.

With 4.17 h of training time for 8000 activity episodes, the proposed SSL approach consumes at most 20 KB of CPU memory space, while providing a maximum accuracy of 90% and 100% classification rates.},

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models.},

  abstract = {The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to urgent needs for reliable diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current guideline is using RT-PCR for testing. As a complimentary tool with diagnostic imaging, chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been shown to be able to reveal visual patterns characteristic for COVID-19, which has definite value at several stages during the disease course. To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided characterization and diagnosis with chest CT scan, which has shown promising results. However, domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge when deploying learning-based models. A common way to alleviate this issue is to fine-tune the model locally with the target domains local data and annotations. Unfortunately, the availability and quality of local annotations usually varies due to heterogeneity in equipment and distribution of medical resources across the globe. This impact may be pronounced in the detection of COVID-19, since the relevant patterns vary in size, shape, and texture. In this work, we attempt to find a solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy. Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a distributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared to fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model weight sharing.},

  abstract = {Bladder cancer (BCa), as the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system, has received significant attention in research on the clinical application of artificial intelligence algorithms. Nevertheless, it has been observed that certain investigations use data from various medical facilities to train models for BCa, which may pose a privacy risk. Given this concern, protecting patient privacy during machine learning algorithm training is a crucial aspect that requires substantial attention. One emerging machine learning paradigm that addresses this concern is federated learning (FL). FL enables multiple entities to collaboratively build machine learning models while preserving data privacy and security. In this study, we present a multicenter BCa magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. The dataset comprises 275 three-dimensional bladder T2-weighted MRI scans collected from four medical centers, and each scan includes diagnostic pathological labels for muscle invasion and pixel-level annotations of tumor contours. Four FL methods are used to assess the baseline of the dataset for both the task of diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer and automatic bladder tumor lesion segmentation.},

Deep learning models have shown promise for automatically segmenting MS lesions, but the scarcity of accurately annotated data hinders progress in this area. Obtaining sufficient data from a single clinical site is challenging and does not address the heterogeneous need for model robustness. Conversely, the collection of data from multiple sites introduces data privacy concerns and potential label noise due to varying annotation standards. To address this dilemma, we explore the use of the federated learning framework while considering label noise. Our approach enables collaboration among multiple clinical sites without compromising data privacy under a federated learning paradigm that incorporates a noise-robust training strategy based on label correction. Specifically, we introduce a Decoupled Hard Label Correction (DHLC) strategy that considers the imbalanced distribution and fuzzy boundaries of MS lesions, enabling the correction of false annotations based on prediction confidence. We also introduce a Centrally Enhanced Label Correction (CELC) strategy, which leverages the aggregated central model as a correction teacher for all sites, enhancing the reliability of the correction process. Extensive experiments conducted on two multi-site datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods, indicating their potential for clinical applications in multi-site collaborations to train better deep learning models with lower cost in data collection and annotation.},

Recent confidentiality trends and a rising number of infringements in different sectors make it crucial to implement new methods that protect data privacy while maintaining accuracy and sustainability. Moreover, the intermittent nature of remote clients with imbalanced datasets poses a significant obstacle for decentralized healthcare systems. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized and privacy-protecting approach to deep learning and machine learning models. In this article, we implement a scalable FL framework for interactive smart healthcare systems with intermittent clients using chest X-ray images. Remote hospitals may have imbalanced datasets with intermittent clients communicating with the FL global server. The data augmentation method is used to balance datasets for local model training. In practice, some clients may leave the training process while others join due to technical or connectivity issues. The proposed method is tested with five to eighteen clients and different testing data sizes to evaluate performance in various situations. The experiments show that the proposed FL approach produces competitive results when dealing with two distinct problems, such as intermittent clients and imbalanced data. These findings would encourage medical institutions to collaborate and use rich private data to quickly develop a powerful patient diagnostic model.},
