## Conclusion
The systematic review of 142 articles, supported by comprehensive visualizations (Figures 1-7), reveals significant progress in technical solutions for privacy-preserving AI in medicine. As demonstrated in our forest plots (Figures 4-5), federated learning and synthetic data generation emerge as key solutions with strong effect sizes for enabling collaborative research while protecting patient privacy. The theme analysis visualization (Figure 6) highlights growing attention to fairness and bias in AI systems, marking an important shift toward more equitable healthcare delivery. While technical advances in privacy preservation show promise, our quality assessment (Figure 2) reveals crucial gaps in long-term validation, cost-effectiveness, and standardization. The implementation framework (Figure 7) provides a structured path forward, emphasizing the need to maintain momentum in privacy protection, bias mitigation, and ethical framework development. The integration of privacy-preserving techniques with bias-aware methodologies, as mapped in our thematic analysis, presents a promising direction for developing AI systems that are both secure and equitable.
