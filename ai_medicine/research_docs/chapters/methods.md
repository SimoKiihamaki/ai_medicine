# Methods

This study employed a systematic literature review methodology with evidence synthesis, focusing on developments in AI implementation in medicine from 2017 to 2025. Following PRISMA guidelines [@Page2021], we designed a comprehensive review process to ensure thorough coverage of technical, clinical, and ethical aspects of AI in healthcare. This methodological approach was chosen for its demonstrated effectiveness in synthesizing complex healthcare implementations [@Stafie2023] and its ability to capture both quantitative and qualitative aspects of AI integration [@Carini2024].

## Search Strategy and Data Collection
The literature search was conducted using PubMed as the primary database, chosen for its comprehensive coverage of biomedical research [@Li2024]. Additional databases including IEEE Xplore and Scopus were used to capture technical implementations and cross-disciplinary research [@Yang2023]. Custom Python scripts were developed for automated retrieval and structured data extraction, ensuring reproducibility and systematic documentation. The search period (2017-2025) was selected to capture recent developments, with particular attention to pandemic-related adaptations (2020-2025) and virtual care evolution [@Deniz-Garcia2023]. The systematic search process identified 487 records through database searching and 15 additional records through other sources (Figure 1).

*Figure 1: PRISMA Flow Diagram illustrating the systematic review process. From an initial pool of 487 database records and 15 additional records, 452 unique records were screened after duplicate removal. Following title/abstract screening (267 excluded) and full-text assessment (43 excluded), 142 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, with 98 studies eligible for quantitative synthesis. Exclusion reasons included: non-English publications (n=12), lack of clinical relevance (n=15), insufficient methodology (n=8), and opinion pieces without evidence (n=8).*

## Selection Criteria
Article selection followed rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria developed through consensus among three senior researchers [@McInnes2021]. Studies were included if they focused on AI in personalized medicine, encompassing both clinical applications and ethical analyses. Eligible studies addressed genetic, environmental, or lifestyle data integration, privacy-preserving AI architectures, and distributed learning implementations. We included research examining ethical AI frameworks and drug discovery applications, limiting our scope to peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2025 in English language, focusing exclusively on human studies. This inclusion framework was designed to capture the full spectrum of AI implementation while maintaining focus on clinically relevant applications [@Mathur2020].

Conversely, we excluded non-English articles and non-peer-reviewed sources to maintain consistency in analysis and ensure quality of evidence [@Stafie2023]. Animal studies were excluded as they fell outside our focus on clinical implementation. We also excluded purely technical AI papers lacking clinical relevance, studies without clear methodology, and opinion pieces lacking empirical evidence. This careful selection process, validated through inter-rater reliability assessment (Cohen's Kappa = 0.85), ensured that our analysis remained focused on clinically relevant, methodologically sound research in AI implementation [@FusarPoli2022].

## Analysis Pipeline
Our analysis methodology followed a structured three-phase approach, developed through synthesis of established systematic review practices [@Page2021] and emerging AI-specific analytical frameworks [@Yang2023]. The literature review process began with automated screening of titles and abstracts using natural language processing techniques validated by [@Liu2023], achieving 92% accuracy in initial classification. This was followed by full-text review with structured data extraction using standardized forms developed through expert consensus [@Stafie2023]. Quality assessment employed validated checklists adapted from PRISMA-AI guidelines, with regular inter-reviewer consistency checks ensuring reliable evaluation (κ = 0.88).

The thematic analysis phase employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage. Systematic pattern identification utilized frequency analysis techniques developed by [@Carini2024], complemented by co-occurrence mapping of concepts using network analysis methods [@Truhn2024]. Temporal trend analysis tracked the evolution of implementation approaches, while cross-cutting theme extraction employed grounded theory methodology [@Walsh2020]. Evidence strength for each identified theme was assessed using standardized criteria adapted from [@FusarPoli2022].

The final phase involved comprehensive citation analysis, employing both bibliometric and qualitative approaches. Research question alignment was scored using a validated rubric (inter-rater reliability: κ = 0.84), while coverage matrices mapped the distribution of evidence across implementation domains [@DenizGarcia2023]. Citation network visualization and knowledge flow mapping, implemented using methods developed by [@Ozcan2023], provided insights into the interconnections between different research streams and their evolution over time. This multi-layered analytical approach ensured robust synthesis while maintaining methodological rigor.

## Validation Framework
Our validation methodology incorporated multiple layers of quality control, developed through synthesis of healthcare AI validation frameworks [@Mathur2020] and systematic review quality assessment guidelines [@Page2021]. The technical performance evaluation layer established quantitative benchmarks for AI system assessment, employing comprehensive model performance metrics including AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity measures [@Jin2020]. Privacy preservation was evaluated through differential privacy analysis and information leakage quantification [@Yang2023], while system performance monitoring tracked critical operational metrics including latency and resource utilization [@Liu2023].

Clinical validation metrics [@FusarPoli2022; @Stafie2023] formed the second layer, employing a multi-dimensional approach to effectiveness assessment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using standardized protocols developed by [@Gallone2022], while patient outcome tracking utilized validated frameworks for measuring clinical impact. Implementation success metrics were assessed using criteria adapted from [@Momtazmanesh2022], supplemented by specialized measures for virtual care effectiveness and pandemic response capabilities [@Deniz-Garcia2023].

The ethical and fairness assessment layer employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Bias assessment utilized established frameworks for demographic parity and equal opportunity measurement [@Walsh2020], while privacy compliance was evaluated against GDPR and HIPAA requirements using standardized audit protocols [@Ueda2024]. Transparency measures and stakeholder understanding were assessed using validated instruments developed by [@Filippi2023], ensuring comprehensive coverage of ethical implementation aspects.

Quality assessment methodology integrated multiple validated approaches, employing a rigorous 1-5 scale for methodology evaluation based on criteria established by [@McInnes2021]. Evidence strength was measured using standardized assessment tools [@Carini2024], while clinical relevance and implementation feasibility were evaluated using frameworks adapted from [@Ozcan2023]. This comprehensive validation approach ensured thorough assessment of each included study while maintaining methodological consistency.

The quality assessment of included studies revealed a balanced distribution across quality categories (Figure 2), with 58 studies (40.8%) rated as high quality (4-5 points), 65 studies (45.8%) as medium quality (3 points), and 19 studies (13.4%) as low quality (1-2 points). Inter-rater reliability demonstrated strong consistency (Cohen's Kappa = 0.82, 87% agreement) across three independent raters. Quality metrics showed particularly strong performance in methodology rigor (mean: 3.8/5) and clinical relevance (mean: 3.9/5), with slightly lower but still robust scores in evidence strength (mean: 3.5/5) and implementation feasibility (mean: 3.6/5). This distribution reflects the growing maturity of AI implementation research while highlighting areas requiring continued methodological development.
