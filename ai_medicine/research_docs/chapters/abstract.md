# Abstract

*Artificial intelligence* (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This systematic review analyzes the current state of AI implementation in medicine, with particular emphasis on privacy-preserving techniques, ethical considerations, and clinical validation frameworks. Through comprehensive analysis of 159 articles identified through PubMed database searching (2017-2025), of which 125 were included after abstract review, we identify critical implementation patterns and evaluate privacy preservation strategies. The thematic analysis highlights key trends in AI implementation, privacy preservation, and ethical considerations in healthcare. Federated learning emerged as a dominant methodology, demonstrating effectiveness in enabling secure multi-institutional collaboration. This review establishes a comprehensive framework for responsible AI deployment in healthcare, emphasizing the critical integration of privacy-preserving architectures, standardized validation protocols, and robust ethical guidelines. This analysis provides essential guidance for healthcare institutions implementing AI systems, while highlighting crucial areas for future research and development.
