# Abstract

*Artificial intelligence* (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This systematic review analyzes the current state of AI implementation in medicine, with particular emphasis on privacy-preserving techniques, ethical considerations, and clinical validation frameworks. Through comprehensive analysis of literature from 2017-2025, we identify key implementation patterns, privacy preservation strategies, and ethical frameworks necessary for responsible AI deployment in healthcare. Our findings highlight the critical role of federated learning and distributed approaches in addressing data privacy concerns, while emphasizing the importance of standardized validation protocols and ethical guidelines for clinical integration.
