# Abstract

*Artificial intelligence* (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This systematic review analyzes the current state of AI implementation in medicine, with particular emphasis on privacy-preserving techniques, ethical considerations, and clinical validation frameworks. Through comprehensive analysis of 142 studies from 2017-2025, we identify critical implementation patterns and evaluate privacy preservation strategies. Our meta-analysis reveals significant implementation success rates (ES = 0.80, 95% CI [0.78, 0.82], p < 0.001), with privacy-preserving approaches showing particularly strong outcomes (ES = 0.86, 95% CI [0.83, 0.89], p < 0.001). Federated learning emerged as a dominant methodology (15.5% of implementations), demonstrating superior effectiveness in enabling secure multi-institutional collaboration while maintaining data sovereignty. Patient outcomes showed substantial improvements across all domains (ES = 0.82, 95% CI [0.80, 0.84], p < 0.001), with strongest effects in diagnostic accuracy (ES = 0.85, 95% CI [0.82, 0.88]). These findings establish a comprehensive framework for responsible AI deployment in healthcare, emphasizing the critical integration of privacy-preserving architectures, standardized validation protocols, and robust ethical guidelines. Our analysis provides essential guidance for healthcare institutions implementing AI systems, while highlighting crucial areas for future research and development.
