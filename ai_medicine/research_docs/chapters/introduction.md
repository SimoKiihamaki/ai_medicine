# Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare represents a paradigm shift in medical practice, offering potential improvements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care delivery [@Price2019; @Khanam2024]. Recent systematic reviews have highlighted significant advances in AI applications [@Stafie2023; @Carini2024], yet critical challenges persist in implementation, privacy preservation, and ethical framework development [@Li2024; @Petkovic2024b]. While previous analyses have examined specific aspects of AI in healthcare, a comprehensive synthesis of implementation strategies, privacy-preserving architectures, and ethical frameworks remains lacking [@Marques2024]. This systematic review addresses these critical knowledge gaps, providing a detailed analysis of developments from 2017 to 2025, with particular attention to the transformative impact of the global pandemic on healthcare AI adoption [@Deniz-Garcia2023; @Almansour2024]. #implementation-clinical #ethics-research

## Purpose and Scope
This study systematically analyzes and documents the current state of artificial intelligence in medicine, with particular focus on implementation challenges, privacy considerations, and ethical frameworks. Our analysis encompasses literature from 2017-2025, providing a comprehensive examination of evolving approaches to AI integration in healthcare settings. This review makes three primary contributions: (1) a synthesis of implementation success factors across diverse healthcare contexts, (2) a comparative analysis of privacy-preserving architectures with specific attention to federated learning approaches, and (3) a comprehensive framework for ethical AI deployment that addresses both technical and societal considerations. By examining 159 studies, of which 125 were included after abstract review, we provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare institutions navigating AI integration. #implementation-workflow #privacy-infrastructure

## Research Questions
Based on identified gaps in current literature and emerging healthcare needs, this review addresses five fundamental questions:

1. What are the primary challenges in implementing AI in clinical practice, and how do these vary across different healthcare contexts? This question addresses the critical need for understanding implementation barriers identified by [@Alowais2023], [@Pethani2021], and recent work by [@Nashwan2024] and [@Reza2024]. #implementation-challenges

2. How can privacy and data security be maintained while leveraging AI in healthcare, particularly in multi-institutional collaborations? This builds on privacy preservation frameworks proposed by [@Price2019], [@Yang2023], and recent advances by [@Monah2022] and [@Koetzier2024]. #privacy-preserving #privacy-security

3. What ethical frameworks are necessary for responsible AI deployment, and how can these be effectively operationalized? This extends ethical considerations discussed by [@Walsh2020], [@Jaremko2019], and recent frameworks by [@Marques2024] and [@Ueda2024]. #ethics-governance #ethics-fairness

4. How can federated and distributed learning approaches address data privacy concerns while enabling effective collaboration? This question explores emerging solutions documented by [@Truhn2024], [@Liu2023], and recent implementations by [@Li2025a] and [@Ali2023]. #privacy-infrastructure #implementation-technical

5. What are the key considerations for clinical validation and integration of AI systems, particularly in ensuring reliable and equitable healthcare delivery? This addresses validation challenges identified by [@Mathur2020], [@Jin2020], and recent validation frameworks by [@Bhange2025] and [@Vitt2024]. #implementation-clinical #ethics-clinical

## Theoretical Framework
Our analysis is grounded in four interconnected theoretical domains that together provide a comprehensive framework for understanding AI implementation in healthcare. The first domain focuses on privacy-preserving AI [@Price2019; @Zerka2021; @Salam2021], encompassing critical technologies such as federated learning, distributed learning, and homomorphic encryption. Recent advances in secure multi-party computation have enabled unprecedented levels of collaborative analysis while maintaining data privacy [@Yang2023; @Guo2024]. These approaches are complemented by model-to-data strategies [@Mehta2020; @Koetzier2024] that fundamentally transform how AI models interact with sensitive healthcare data, enabling secure analysis without direct data access. The emergence of federated learning frameworks [@Li2025a; @Ali2023] has further strengthened privacy-preserving capabilities in multi-institutional settings. #privacy-preserving #privacy-security

The second domain addresses clinical implementation challenges [@Mathur2020; @Pethani2021], examining the complex interplay between technical integration requirements and healthcare delivery systems. This domain has evolved significantly during the pandemic era, as documented by [@Stafie2023; @Khanam2024], with particular attention to validation requirements, system interoperability, and the emerging complexities of multi-institutional collaboration. Recent implementations by [@Mascarenhas2023] and [@Alhur2024] have demonstrated successful integration strategies, while the pandemic-driven shift toward virtual care has introduced new implementation considerations that require careful evaluation [@Deniz-Garcia2023; @Almansour2024]. #implementation-clinical #implementation-workflow

Ethical considerations constitute the third domain [@Walsh2020; @Jaremko2019; @Nebeker2019], addressing crucial aspects of fairness, bias, transparency, and accountability in AI deployment. This framework has matured significantly, moving beyond theoretical constructs to practical implementation guidelines. Recent work by [@Ueda2024] and [@Filippi2023] has demonstrated how ethical principles can be effectively operationalized in clinical settings, while studies by [@Marques2024] and [@Petkovic2024b] have advanced our understanding of maintaining privacy protection, patient trust, and healthcare equity across diverse populations. #ethics-clinical #ethics-fairness
