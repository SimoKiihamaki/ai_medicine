## Risk of Bias Assessment
The systematic assessment of risk of bias across the included studies, conducted using the modified Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool [@Higgins2022] and ROBINS-I framework [@Sterne2019], revealed a predominantly low to moderate risk profile (Figure 3). Following standardized assessment protocols [@Page2021], we evaluated 142 studies, of which 67 (47.2%) demonstrated low risk of bias, 52 (36.6%) showed moderate risk, and 23 (16.2%) were classified as high risk. Analysis across specific bias domains, using criteria established by [@McInnes2021], showed strongest performance in attrition bias (55% low risk) and performance bias (52% low risk), with detection bias showing the most room for improvement (45% low risk). Implementation studies demonstrated the most robust methodological quality, with 56% classified as low risk, while validation studies showed higher susceptibility to bias, with 26% classified as high risk. This distribution aligns with patterns observed in recent systematic reviews of healthcare AI [@Stafie2023].

## Quantitative Synthesis
Meta-analysis of implementation outcomes, conducted following established healthcare implementation science guidelines [@Higgins2022], revealed significant positive effects across multiple domains (Figures 4-5). Using random-effects models [@Borenstein2021] to account for implementation heterogeneity, the implementation success rate analysis (Figure 4) demonstrated strong overall effectiveness (ES = 0.80, 95% CI [0.78, 0.82], p < 0.001), with privacy preservation showing the highest success rates (ES = 0.86, 95% CI [0.83, 0.89], p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis, following methods established by [@Page2021], revealed varying success rates across implementation domains: technical integration (ES = 0.82, 95% CI [0.79, 0.85]), clinical workflow (ES = 0.74, 95% CI [0.71, 0.77]), and ethical framework implementation (ES = 0.78, 95% CI [0.75, 0.81]). Heterogeneity analysis showed moderate overall heterogeneity (I² = 45%, τ² = 0.03, Q = 32.5, df = 18, p = 0.019), with lower heterogeneity in privacy preservation studies (I² = 32%) compared to clinical workflow studies (I² = 51%). Sensitivity analysis excluding low-quality studies (n = 3) did not significantly alter the results (overall ES = 0.79, 95% CI [0.77, 0.81]).
