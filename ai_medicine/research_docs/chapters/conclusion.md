# Conclusion

This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI implementation in medicine from 2017 to 2025, with particular emphasis on implementation challenges, privacy considerations, and ethical frameworks. The findings reveal significant progress in privacy-preserving technologies, particularly federated learning [@Li2025a] and distributed approaches [@Deist2017], which have enabled secure multi-institutional collaboration while maintaining data privacy [@Price2019]. The pandemic era (2020-2025) has accelerated digital transformation in healthcare [@Deniz-Garcia2023], leading to rapid adoption of virtual care platforms and remote healthcare delivery systems [@Stafie2023].

Our analysis has revealed several significant developments in the field, which include: evolution of privacy-preserving technologies, maturation of ethical frameworks, development of comprehensive clinical validation protocols, emergence of standardized approaches to AI implementation, and integration of pandemic-specific considerations into AI deployment strategies.

Despite these significant advances, the field continues to face several critical challenges, as highlighted by recent studies [@Marques2024; @Ueda2024; @Petkovic2024b]. These challenges include the need for standardized validation protocols, limited long-term effectiveness data, varying quality of implementation reporting, and ensuring equitable access to AI-enabled healthcare.

Future research should focus on developing standardized validation protocols, conducting long-term effectiveness studies, and ensuring equitable access to AI-enabled healthcare services. The field would benefit from unified reporting guidelines and comprehensive implementation assessment tools.

This systematic review makes several substantial contributions to the field of AI in medicine, such as: providing a structured analysis of AI implementation patterns, identifying effective privacy-preserving strategies, documenting the evolution of ethical frameworks, establishing a foundation for standardized validation protocols, and offering insights into pandemic-era adaptations and their long-term implications.

The findings support the continued development of privacy-preserving AI technologies while emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and standardized validation approaches in healthcare implementation.
