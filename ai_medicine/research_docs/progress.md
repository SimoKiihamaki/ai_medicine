# Writing Progress Update (1/31/2025 15:22)

## URGENT: Citation Alignment Required
### Bibliography Issues
1. Missing Citations
   - Identified 30+ missing citations in bibliography_inc.bib
   - Critical references needed for key arguments
   - Affects multiple sections of manuscript
   - **Action Taken:** Missing citations merged from `research_docs/bibliography.bib` to `research_docs/bibliography_inc.bib` and bibliography_inc.bib rewritten using write_to_file

2. Citation Format Standardization
   - Inconsistent citation formats identified
   - Hyphenation issues (e.g., DenizGarcia2023)
   - Format verification needed for all references
   - **Status:** Pending verification

### Action Timeline
**Immediate (Jan 31 - Feb 1):**
- **Completed:** Collect all missing citations from manuscript
- **Completed:** Add missing references to bibliography_inc.bib and rewrite file
- **Next:** Standardize citation formats
- **Next:** Verify all citations in manuscript (Requires Code Mode)
